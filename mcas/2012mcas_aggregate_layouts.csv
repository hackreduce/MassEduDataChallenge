"Note 1: Performance level results are suppressed if the number of students included is fewer than 10. Student growth percentiles are suppressed if the number of students included in growth percentile calculations is fewer than 20. ",
,
"Note 2: School-level results (for all tests except grade 10 Science) include only students enrolled in the same school since October 2011.",
,
"Note 3: Grade 10 Science results represent the highest performance level attained by class of 2014 students taking a Science and Technology/Engineering (STE) test when they were in grade 9 or in grade 10 in any of the four subjects (Biology, Chemistry, Introductory Physics, and Technology/Engineering). In addition, only students enrolled in Massachusetts since October 2010 are included in state-level results; only students enrolled in the same district since October 2010 are included in district-level results; only students enrolled in the same school since October 2010 are included in school-level results.",
